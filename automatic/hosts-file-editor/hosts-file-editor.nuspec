    <summary>Easily edit and manage the hosts file for Windows.</summary>
    <description>
      Features
      ========

      Edit the hosts file:

      - Cut, copy, paste, duplicate, enable, disable and move one or more entries at a time
      - Filter and sort when there are a large number of host entries
      - Enable and disable entire hostsfile from application or tray
      - Archive and restore various hostsfile configurations when switching between environments
      - Automatically ping endpoints to check availability

      Usage Notes
      ===========

      By default the application closes to the tray. To exit completely you must select Exit
      from the File menu or tray context menu. Only one instance of the application is allowed
      at a time. If you try to open it again it will just activate the previously running
      instance.

      When selecting rows to move, delete, copy, or cut be sure to select the entire row using
      the row header cell. If no entire rows are selected, cut, copy, paste, and delete apply
      individually to the selected cells.

      Using the filter and sort while editing is quirky. The filter and sort are applied once
      a cell is edited so your cell may change positions or disappear depending on the current sort
      and filter.
