    <description>
Docker Toolbox is an installer for quick setup and launch of a Docker environment on older Mac and Windows systems that do not meet the requirements of the new [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) and [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) apps.

Toolbox includes these Docker tools:

* Docker Machine for running docker-machine commands
* Docker Engine for running the docker commands
* Docker Compose for running the docker-compose commands
* Kitematic, the Docker GUI (deselected)
* a shell preconfigured for a Docker command-line environment
* Oracle VirtualBox (deselected)

## Maintainers note:
The Docker Client for Windows as well as Docker Machine for Windows are 'fixed'
components. Docker Compose for Windows is 'optional' but already selected, as is
Kitematic for Windows (Alpha). The installation of VirtualBox, however, were
deselected as the version shipped with the Docker Toolbox installer tends to be
outdated.

You can override this by specifying `-ia /COMPONENTS="kitematic,virtualbox,dockercompose"`.

An existing installation of Git for Windows is used *if* it is installed in its
default installation path (c:\Program Files\Git); this apparently cannot be overridden.

By default, Desktop Icons will be installed, and the system-wide PATH will be
updated to include the Docker Toolbox installation. An existing Docker VM will however
not be upgraded automatically.

The following tasks can be selected/deselected:

```
desktopicon = Create a desktop shortcut
modifypath  = Add docker binaries to PATH
upgradevm   = Upgrade Boot2Docker VM
```

by using `-ia /TASKS="desktopicon,modifypath,upgradevm"`. Note, however, the the
PATH modification is done by chocolatey, not the Docker Toolbox installer (it has
a bug in the PATH setting), so that the `modifypath` task will have no impact.
